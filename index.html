			<h2>What is Project Based Learning?</h2>
			<p> PBL is applying real-life challenges where the focus is on real problems or questions.
			 In order to pass classes, students study meaningless “drills” which do not provide any benefit later in life, when they could be using their skills in a real-world simulation.
			 According to <a href="https://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files1/aac48826d9652cb154e2dbf0033376fa.pdf">A Review of Research on Project-Based Learning</a>,  PBL is a more effective teaching strategy that is being used in many places.
			  It teaches students to solve a "driving question" without being fully guided by teachers. As of right now, students show and apply their knowledge through tests, which is the most common form of assessment.
			   Although a majority of teachers use tests to measure students' knowledge, project-based learning can help students apply their knowledge, collaborate with others, and solve a "driving question".

			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>Where is a good place to start?</h3>
			<p>Start by talking to other teacher who use project-based learning and bounce ideas off them. Share resources with other teachers 
			such as rubrics and project ideas. </p>
			<h3>What changes will I see in my students?</h3>
			<p>Grades will increase but project-based learning has other benefits. There will be a major increase in performance.
			 Also students will become focused in their everyday work in class. 

			</p>
			<h3>Will my students struggle with the switch to project-based learning?</h3>
			<p>The only students who struggle are those who are not willing to try and think teachers should just hand them infomation.</p>
			<h3>Do students become more involved in class with the use of project-based learning? </h3>
			<p>Students become more focused. Teaching with project-based learning is better than worksheets. Students listen better rather than zoning out.
			</p>
			<h3>Are there any problems with project-based learning?</h3>
			<p>When students are absent they can fall behind other than that no.</p>
